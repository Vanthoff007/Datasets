# Datasets

This repository is a collection of datasets I’ve created over time, either as part of personal projects, experiments, or to fill gaps I noticed in existing public data. Each dataset is designed with practical use in mind—whether it's for analysis, model training, or simply exploring interesting patterns. I put this together not just to document my work, but also to share resources that others might find useful in their own data science and machine learning journeys. If you're looking for clean, well-structured datasets to play with or build on, I hope this repo serves you well.
